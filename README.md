# Node-Js Repository

This repository contains a growing collection of Node.js projects, templates, experiments, and practice modules. Each project lives in its own folder and works independently, allowing you to explore different backend concepts without mixing code.

The repository will continue expanding, so this README focuses on the overall structure and usage rather than naming individual projects.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repo acts as a personal playground for:

* Practicing Node.js and Express fundamentals
* Testing routing, middlewares, APIs, templating engines, and server patterns
* Building multiple small standalone applications
* Reusing boilerplates for new ideas

Whether you're learning or experimenting, this repository grows with every new project you add.

## 📦 How to Run Any Project

Follow this pattern for every project:

### **1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MokshPShah/Node-Js.git
cd Node-Js
```

### **2. Enter the project folder**

```bash
cd project-folder-name
```

### **3. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

### **4. Start the server**

```bash
npm start
```

Or manually:

```bash
node app.js
```

### **5. Open in browser**

```
http://localhost:3000

## 📘 What This Repo Helps You Learn

* Setting up Node.js + Express servers
* Using EJS for dynamic UI
* Route handling (GET/POST)
* Serving static files
* Working with JSON and basic CRUD patterns
* Structuring scalable project folders
* Building reusable backend templates

Future additions may include:

* API-based projects
* Authentication examples
* Utility modules
* More complex full-stack mini apps

## 🏗️ Adding New Projects

When adding a new project:

* Create a separate folder
* Add `package.json` and server file (`app.js` or `server.js`)
* Maintain `views/` and `public/` structure
* Keep the project fully independent
* (Optional) Add a README inside the project folder

This keeps the repo clean and scalable.
